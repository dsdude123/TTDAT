# TTDAT
Utility for TT Games LEGO games. Currently only to be used with LEGO City Undercover (PC ver). 
The tool will go through a single DAT archive or all DAT archives in the provided folder and output a comma-seperated CSV. Useful for pin-pointing which archive is needed if you're after a specific file.
